1. Check out `happygrep` into `~/happygrep`.

        $ cd
        $ git clone git://github.com/happygrep/happygrep.git 

2. Then go to `~/happygrep/search/curse/` directory, compire and install it.

        $ cd ~/happypeter/search/curse/
        $ make
        $ sudo make install

is the default search path in unbuntu, so it is not neccessary to add `~/bin`
to `PATH` environment variable.
