for Chinese support, you need to install the `w` version of lib ncurse

    sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev

MAC:

    since I do not know how to install dev headers for ncurses on mac, so I stupidly copied the 

        ncurses.h

    from a linux machine, and then use

        gcc -I.

    it sucks.
